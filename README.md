## [Project 1: Trading Company Overview Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CompanyOverview_17644470068300/CompanyOverview?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard demonstrates how user growth, money flows, and trading activity can be analyzed at a **country level** using a single, coherent analytical view. It was built using dummy data defined in the [`data_creation.sql`](https://github.com/marsel-khusnutdin/Trading-Company-Dashboard/blob/main/data_creation.sql) file.

The dashboard is structured into three sections:
- **Onboarding** – visualizes the user funnel, conversion rates, and monthly onboarding performance.
- **Transactions** – highlights deposit and withdrawal behavior, including net cash flow trends.
- **Trading Volume** – shows overall trading activity, country comparisons, and volume efficiency metrics (VPM).

The goal of this dashboard is to show how different visualization choices can be combined to explain **user behavior, financial performance, and geographic differences**, while keeping the analysis clear and decision-oriented.
